                  <h4>Identifying</h4>
                  <p>Scallops can be identified by their fan-shaped shells.  The rectangular edge of their shell acts a hinge when the shell opens.</p>
                  <h4>Marking</h4>
                  <p>Mark the length and width of the scallop.  First click on the shell edge at the center point of the fan shape and drag to base of the hinge.  This gives the length.  Next click the edge at the widest point of the shell and drag to the opposite side.  This gives the width.</p>

                  <p>Fish include many species.  In addition to the usual suspects like cod and haddock, eels, sharks and rays are also considered fish. Some species, like hagfish, are jawless fish that resemble eels and should be identified as fish as well.</p>
                  <h4>Marking</h4>
                  <p>Mark the widest and longest portions of the fish’s body including the tail.  Don’t include fins. First click on the edge of the widest point of the animal and drag to the opposite side. This gives the width.  Next click the end of longest edge of the animal and drag to the opposite side.  This gives the length.</p>

                  <h4>Marking</h4>
                  <p>To mark a seastar first click the center point of its body, where the arms converge.  Drag the point to the tip of the longest arm to mark its radius.</p>

                  <p>Crustaceans’ bodies are segmented and covered by a hard exoskeleton.  Lobsters, crabs, hermit crabs and shrimp are all examples of crustaceans.</p>
                  <h4>Marking</h4>
                  <p>Mark the length and width of the crustacean.  First click on the edge of the widest point of the animal and drag to the opposite side. This gives us the width.  Next click the longest edge of the animal and drag to the opposite side.  This gives the length. In the special case of a hermit crab, you can include the shell they are living in.</p>

                  <p>If you are unsure if you are looking at an anemone or seastar, if it has more than 16 arm-like features, then it is an aneomne.  If there is an anemone in the image click the “There Are Other Species Present” button.</p>

                  <p>Karen is an independent fisheries biologist and marine educator. In 1994, she volunteered on a NOAA Sea Scallop Survey and, since then, has worked in and around the commercial fishing industry and has had contracts with NOAA in the bioacoustics, food web, and population dynamics programs. In Iceland, she researched Atlantic cod stock structure using mainly meristic and gadid egg and larvae imaging techniques. In Australia, she worked cooperatively with the commercial reef fishing industry and also researched sea turtle populations and nesting dynamics. She obtained a B.S. from Westfield State University and a M.Sc. in Fisheries and Wildlife Conservation from The University of Massachusetts Amherst. Her thesis involved discriminating Atlantic herring stocks using morphometrics and imaging tools. Since 2006, she has been conducting cooperative research with the commercial scallop industry. In the HabCam Project, she mainly analyzes images, conducts quality control procedures, and coordinates the outreach and education programs.</p>

                  <p>Scott started life in electrical engineering but was advised in 1970 that that field was a dead end (obviously a very short sighted advisor). He finished his undergraduate degrees in pre-medicine and Limnology. Realizing that Oceanography was much more fun than studying lakes and medicine was just not his style, he started working at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) and finished a Ph.D. He is currently a tenured Associate Scientist at WHOI with engineering interests in the development of optical instrumentation. On the science side, he is involved in developing automated image informatics for identification of plankton and benthic organisms to address questions related to changes in biodiversity and community structure in response to physical forcing (currents, mixing, nutrient exchange, climate change, ocean acidification, etc.)</p>

                  <p>Amber’s marine science inspiration started early as the daughter of two marine biologists living on Oahu, Hawaii. After her early years she moved to another seaside location near the Woods Hole Community on Cape Cod, MA. After her undergraduate Marine Biology work at Boston University, she started working at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Dr. Scott Gallager’s lab where she learned how important computer science is to large volumes of biological data, especially imagery. Though she does not intend to abandon her biological roots, she is currently pursuing a second degree in Computer Science. As a Research Associate in Scott’s lab, in addition to HabCam projects, she works on a variety of projects including underwater marine observatories. Her interests include seastar taxonomy, data visualization, database design and management, and fish behaviour. She is involved in a wide range of tasks within the HabCam Group from participating in research cruises, to processing images, fiber-optic termination, physical sampling, species identification, data management, and image annotation.</p>
